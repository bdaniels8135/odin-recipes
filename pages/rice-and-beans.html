            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            Growing up in a diverse town meant having lots of exposure to different foods.
            Spanish rice and beans was one of the mainstays of my diet even as a white boy.
            Don't worry though. I am not giving away anyone's family recipe.
            Just one I developed on my own over the years. I won't tell you how to make the sofrito though.
            My adoptive abuelo would never forgive me.
