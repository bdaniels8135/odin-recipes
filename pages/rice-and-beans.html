    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        Growing up in a diverse town meant having lots of exposure to different foods.
        Spanish rice and beans was one of the mainstays of my diet even as a white boy.
        Don't worry though. I am not giving away anyone's family recipe.
        Just one I developed on my own over the years. I won't tell you how to make the sofrito though.
        My adoptive abuelo would never forgive me.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Cups Water</li>
        <li>8oz Can Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp Chicken Bouillon</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp Sofrito</li>
        <li>2 Packets of Sazon Seasoning</li>
        <li>4 tsp Adobo</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>4 Cups White Rice</li>
        <li>1 Can Pigeon Peas (Drained and Rinsed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add everything but the rice and peas to a large pot with a thick bottom and lid and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add peas and return to boil.</li>
            <li>Add rice and stir.</li>
            <li>Return contents to a boil and stir the rice a second time.</li>
            <li>Even out the rice in the pot.</li>
            <li>Put the lid on the pot and reduce the heat to medium low or low.</li>
            <li>Let simmer for 20 minutes and turn off the heat. <strong><em>DO NOT TOUCH!</em></strong></li>
            <li>After rice has absorbed the liquid that is resting on the top, fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
